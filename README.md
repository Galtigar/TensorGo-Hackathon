# TensorGo-Hackathon
This Project consists of the assignments that are needed to be submitted by TensorGo which is a three day hackathon event and covers topics related to computer vision and their applications.

The code is developed on the system with config:
- Intel Pentium(R) Dual-Core CPU
- Installed(Ram)- 4.00 Gb
- SystemType - 32-Bit operating system (windows 7)
- Lenovo (2011) Model

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The code can be used for the following use cases:

- It detects whether if a person is sitting infront of the cam or not. Incase the person sits infront of the laptop/desktop,It shows 'person present' and 'not present' if there's no one before the monitor.

- It recognizes the person by taking a repetitive images through the cam and trains those images as a result of which it recognizes the person who has been trained previously.

- If another person enters before the frame incontrast to the former whose images  were previously trained. It shows 'Another person detected' for the new person.
